//! Hardfork slash burns.
//!
//! To burn the bonds of a finalizer `T` slashed at activation height `A`, we must
//! find every bond delegated to `T` at the end of any block in the window `[A - W, A)`. This
//! includes bonds still pointing at `T` (sitting ducks) and bonds that retargeted
//! or unbonded away from `T` inside the window (cockroaches/fleers).
//!
//! Because a Retarget action names both its `from` and `to` finalizers, the whole
//! computation is lazy and local: just before the activation block's staking
//! actions, combine the current bond state (which names every bond still parked on,
//! or unbonding from, a terminated finalizer) with a read of the blocks after `A - W`
//! and below `A` (whose Retarget `from`s name every bond that left one inside the window).
//! No genesis scan, no persistent index, no background catch-up.
//!
//! @Note: Unbond names no `from`, so an unbonding bond is found through its status instead,
//! which keeps the target and dates the unbond. Adding `from` to Unbond, to find it in the
//! scan like Retarget, was tried and dropped: it changes the wire format and adds a
//! consensus rule, and the Unbonding status can't go anyway. Issuance and the roster need
//! to know which bonds are active, and the withdrawal delay needs the unbond height;
//! finding that height by scanning back for the unbond would cost a node an unbounded scan
//! per withdrawal, triggered for free by withdrawals that turn out invalid.
