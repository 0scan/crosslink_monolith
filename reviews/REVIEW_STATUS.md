# Code review status: 22 reported findings and 15 test-format leads

Tracking table. One row per finding. Four sources feed it:

- **Consensus review** (`C` rows): 11 reports in `crosslink-e99404e3de7cc-review/`, validated at `dev` @ `e99404e3de7cc`.
- **GUI review** (`G` rows): 10 reports in `crosslink-d00b6a44ef594-gui-review/`, validated at `dev` @ `d00b6a44ef594`.
- **Sync follow-up** (`S` row): 1 report in `crosslink-e56e35f85a98f-sync-review/`, a lead raised while re-checking commit `e56e35f8` and validated at `dev` @ `e56e35f85a98f`.
- **Test-format review** (`F` and `T` rows): 15 leads on `test_format.rs` and `zebrad/tests/crosslink.rs`, raised at `dev` @ `8ea4db1f`. They have no report files and no severity. The two sessions that own that code checked them and disputed none; see the section below.

Status is assessed against `dev` @ `e56e35f85` on 2026-10-01. Every assessment is from reading code. Nothing was built or run for any review or for this table. Narrative, quotes and fix plans are in the report files. The structure every report follows, and the row formats used below, are in [`SECURITY-ISSUE-TEMPLATE.md`](SECURITY-ISSUE-TEMPLATE.md).

`C` numbers are the ones the consensus reports use to cross-reference each other, so they are kept as they are and the rows are sorted by severity.

### Column meanings

**Sev**: the containing folder: `high`, `medium` or `low`.

**Fires**: what it takes to trigger.

- Consensus rows: `honest` = an ordinary event such as a crash, a restart, a network split or a tip change · `adversary` = needs a dishonest proposer or miner · `config` = not reachable with the shipped parameters.
- GUI rows: every one fires in ordinary use, so the column gives the platforms: `all`, or the ones named.

**Gate**: when it has to land.

- `fork` = the fix changes consensus rules. It is free to land until BFT activation, which is height 36,288 on the shipped parameters. After that it needs a coordinated upgrade. This is a fact about the fix.
- `launch` = node-local or GUI-local, and it should be in before the public launch. This is a recommendation.
- `any` = no deadline.

**Status**: `FIXED` (with commit) · `PARTIAL` (bounded, mechanism survives) · `CLEAR` (obvious fix, not yet done) · `DECIDE` (needs a person) · `MEASURE` (needs a number first) · `EXTERNAL` (cannot be fixed in this repo).

**Test**: which harness exercises it. Three exist:

- `test-format`: the scenario tests in `zebra-crosslink/zebrad/tests/crosslink.rs`, about 45 of them. One in-process node, regtest only, proof of work disabled, ephemeral state, no restart.
- `dilated`: `zebra-crosslink/dilated_regtest/run.sh`. Two child-process nodes with real signatures, real templates and a restart past activation. It asserts liveness only.
- `cargo`: ordinary unit tests. `zebra-gui` has two small test modules and nothing that drives `run_ui` or the chain view.

No finding is covered by any of them today, so every row shows a route not yet taken: `unit` = easy pure-logic test · `intg` = easy with a harness that already exists · `hard` = needs new infrastructure · `none` = manual only.

**Owner**: the area that can close it. `node` = `zebra-state` and its callers · `spec+node` = a consensus rule has to be decided first, then coded · `gui` · `gui+wallet` · `gui+softer_gui` = needs a change in the vendored windowing patch.

Two decisions: how carried headers prove their binding, jointly with C11, and what to do about the testnet minimum-difficulty rule. The contextual check itself is CLEAR |

The abort and the restart exit are bugs against FINALITY.md's "never requires a resync". Decision: ship the interim detached state, or go straight to stage 9. C6.3 and C6.4 are CLEAR either way |
| C7 | [Fat pointer certificate accepted by hash only](crosslink-e99404e3de7cc-review/medium/admit-fat-pointer-accepts-a-certificate-by-hash-without-checking-signatures.md) | medium | adversary | fork | DECIDE | intg | spec+node | Decision: checked certificates, or declare the header pointer hash-only. Finality is not at risk either way. Also on `s1_dev`, where a TODO for it was dropped |
| C3 | [`MISSING_POW_BLOCKS` never expires](crosslink-e99404e3de7cc-review/medium/missing-pow-blocks-grows-without-bound-from-unverified-proposal-snapshots.md) | medium | adversary | launch | CLEAR | unit | node | About 21 bogus hashes fill the 42-slot download budget.

A crash, a hard kill and a disabled backup still strand the node. The dilated run already restarts; the missing step is deleting the backup directory between stop and start |
| C4 | [Restart exits between activation and genesis](crosslink-e99404e3de7cc-review/low/restart-exits-when-killed-between-activation-and-the-bft-genesis-decision.md) | low | honest | launch | CLEAR | hard | node | Delete one guard. Since `8cc3f5b7` a clean stop can land in the window too. The test needs a tool that deletes BFT rows between stop and start |

The part that matters: a missing stake record is treated as zero stake at two sites. Sigma of 0 is still accepted by config validation |

## GUI review (10)

Unreachable on Windows only because paste returns nothing there |

Half of a two-stage Esc: the clearing handler is commented out |

## Sync follow-up (1)

Raised by the "crosslink spreadsheet triage" session while reading `e56e35f8`, then validated by tracing the code. The Fires column uses the consensus values.

| # | Finding | Sev | Fires | Gate | Status | Test | Owner | Notes |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| S1 | [Rejected-block backoff is keyed by hash alone](crosslink-e56e35f85a98f-sync-review/low/rejected-block-backoff-is-keyed-by-hash-alone-so-one-peer-can-delay-an-honest-block-for-every-peer.md) | low | adversary | any | CLEAR | intg | node | Partially confirmed. Each forged copy a peer gets queued under an honest hash stops new requests for that hash to every peer for 1 s doubling to 64 s. One dishonest connection among honest peers normally loses to the honest copy; sustained delay needs most of the node's connections. A regression against `e56e35f8^`, where a forgery cost about one 500 ms pass. The trade-off was weighed in the commit's comments; the existing forged-body test covers one strike only |

## Test-format review (15 leads)

Raised by `/code-review xhigh` on 2026-10-01 against the binary test format and its scenario tests. These rows have no report file, so the Notes column carries the whole lead. `F` rows are about the format and harness in `zebra-crosslink/zebra-crosslink/src/test_format.rs`; `T` rows are about the scenarios in `zebra-crosslink/zebrad/tests/crosslink.rs`.

**Checked by**: `yes` = the session that owns the code confirmed it against `dev` @ `8ea4db1f` · `part` = confirmed with a part it did not verify, named in Notes.

**Owner**: `format` = the "Crosslink binary test format" session · `tests` = the "crosslink spreadsheet triage" session · `node` = the fix is in `zebra-state` · `review` = the "crosslink code review" session, which maintains this file.

| # | Lead | Where | Checked by | Status | Owner | Notes |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| F1 | `SHOULD_FAIL` passes when the harness gets no answer | `test_format.rs:1263` | yes | **PARTIAL** `e56e35f8` | format | In progress: the format session started on F1, then F5 and F6, F3 and F4, and F7, on 2026-10-01. A block with an unknown parent is now answered at once as `Pending`, so the 30 s wait is gone. `ingest_pow` still maps `Pending`, a harness timeout and an unparseable `RECV_POW` to the same "failed" as a real rejection. A test can now pin a deferral by its reason text, as the commit's new test does. Three distinct outcomes are still missing |
| T1 | 14 fork-refusal assertions pass by timeout, not by a refusal | `crosslink.rs:957`, `:1069`, `:2386` | yes | **PARTIAL** `e56e35f8` | tests | Read, not re-run: the 13 orphan blocks and the closing one now get an immediate `Pending`, so about 420 s of waiting goes away. The assertions are unchanged. They still pass because the parent is unknown, and say nothing about the fork-choice floor |
| T2 | First generated PoS block is always invalid; two tests are vacuous | `crosslink.rs:260`, `:361`, `:481` | yes | CLEAR | tests | `regen_test_data` builds it over the two sibling blocks at height 3. Six other PoS files are unused and unloadable |
| F2 | `EXPECT_REJECTION_REASON` cannot say which rule rejected | `test_format.rs:938` | yes | CLEAR | review | Assigned to the review session on 2026-10-01. **On hold: the user's instruction is not to touch real consensus code at the moment**, and the fix is in `validate` and `admit_fat_pointer`. Not started. Every failing exit of `validate` returns `(Fail, None)`. Five PoS tests record identical text. Five `admit_fat_pointer` rules still share one message. `e56e35f8` splits the PoW reason into `header` and `body`, which does not reach these |
| F9 | `LOAD_POS` cannot express a certificate test | `test_format.rs:936` | part | DECIDE | node | A bad signature panics in `decide()` at `bft.rs:1079` instead of returning a rejection; zero signatures are accepted. The format owner did not verify the roster and quorum half, and reads the panic as a node robustness issue. Rides on the C7 decision and on C6.3 |
| F3 | `EXPECT_MEMPOOL_REJECTED` is true for a mined transaction | `test_format.rs:1470` | yes | CLEAR | format | Seen live by the format owner. Five instruction builders have no caller in any test |
| F4 | `EXPECT_POW_BLOCK_FINALITY` has no timeout, and `None` is ambiguous | `test_format.rs:1143` | part | CLEAR | format | Both reads are unbounded and errors map to `None`. Not verified: that an unknown block answers `CantBeFinalized` |
| F5 | The instruction dump panics on odd blocks and can deadlock | `test_format.rs:185` | yes | CLEAR | format | A passing test can hang in the panic hook. The same function runs when the GUI views a file |
| F6 | `read_from_bytes` panics on malformed files and checks no magic | `test_format.rs:568` | yes | CLEAR | format | A wrong file picked in the GUI aborts a running node |
| F7 | Files are not self-describing: calendar omitted, payload unversioned | `test_format.rs:643` | yes | CLEAR | format | Stored scenes changed meaning silently at `00565513`. The owner will fold "always write the calendar" and a version bump into its planned `SET_PARAMS` work |
| F8 | Conformance mode can no longer finish | `test_format.rs:666` | part | CLEAR | format + tests | Same lead as T4. About 20,740 blocks at about 92 ms each against a 360 s limit. The block arithmetic was not re-derived by the owner. Needs a batched block load |
| F10 | Missing instructions | `test_format.rs:77` | yes | CLEAR | format | A hardfork or slash schedule; `fin` and the best tip by hash; restart; an eventual expectation; a handle on a template-mined block; one peer identity across `RECV_TX` and STP. Restart and the schedule were already planned |
| T3 | The scene test rewrites three tracked files on every run | `crosslink.rs:2423` | yes | CLEAR | tests | Another test binary reads them at `viz2.rs:1072`, `:1108`, `:1130`. Compare against the checked-in bytes instead |
| T5 | The bond lifecycle test never asserts bond state | `crosslink.rs:2572` | yes | CLEAR | tests | Only block acceptance and chain length. The one `EXPECT_BOND` ignores the amount |
| T6 | Enforced consensus rules with no scenario | `crosslink.rs:2460` | yes | CLEAR | tests | Twelve named cases, from a null pointer after a non-null parent to the node's own template moving `fin`. Several wait on F9 and F10. The owner will take the ones today's format can express, plus C10's ghost roster |

Status of these 15: **2 PARTIAL**, **1 DECIDE**, **12 CLEAR**. Line numbers are from the review at `8ea4db1f`; `e56e35f8` added 38 lines to `crosslink.rs` at `:1653`, so every later citation there moves down by that much.

## Roll-up

The tables in this section count the 22 reported findings. The test-format leads are counted above.

| Status | High | Medium | Low | Total |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| FIXED | 0 | 0 | 0 | **0** |
| PARTIAL | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| CLEAR (obvious fix, pending) | 2 | 6 | 9 | **17** |
| DECIDE | 3 | 1 | 0 | **4** |
| MEASURE | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| total | 5 | 7 | 10 | **22** |

By trigger, consensus rows: **6 honest**, **4 adversary**, **1 config**. All 10 GUI rows fire in ordinary use. The sync row needs a dishonest peer.

By gate: **3 fork** (C2, C7, C11), **8 launch** (C1, C3, C4, C6, C10, G1, G2, G3), **11 any**.

By test route, what CI would actually catch on a bad push:

| Route | Findings | Runs in CI? |
|-|-|-|
| `test-format`, `dilated`, `cargo` | 0 | n/a |
| **covered subtotal** | **0** | |
| `unit` (easy, unwritten) | 11 | no |
| `intg` (easy, unwritten) | 7 | no |
| `hard` | 3 | no |
| `none` | 1 | never |

**0 of 22 are covered by something that runs automatically.** 18 of them have a cheap route.

## What the table makes obvious

- **Nothing is fixed, and 17 of 22 are waiting on effort, not on a decision.** No recommendation from the consensus or GUI review has landed, apart from filing C11 as its own report.
- **The only movement since the last assessment is on the test side.** `e56e35f8` answers every queued block, which removes the 30 s timeouts behind F1 and T1. It does not make those tests assert what they claim.
- **The test suite cannot yet protect most consensus fixes.** C7 needs F9, C1 and C4 need a restart instruction from F10, and C8 needs a template-on-named-parent instruction.
- **All four decisions are consensus design.** C2 and C11 share one of them: how a header carried in a BFT proposal proves its pointer binding.
- **Three findings have a hard deadline** (C2, C7, C11). The deadline moved in their favour: activation went from height 275 to 36,288, about 10.5 days after genesis at 25 second blocks.
- **Five consensus findings are one piece of startup design**, not five fixes: C1, C4, C6, C10's stake default and C3's re-fetch all meet in `restore()`.
- **The GUI's worst outcome is a node abort, not a wrong pixel.** G3 kills a finalizer or miner through a paste, and fixing G2 first would extend that to Windows.
- **Eleven unit tests would pin eleven findings.** Most need a pure function extracted first, and the reports say which.
- **On a testnet with no dishonest participants, C6, C1 and C4 are the consensus rows that matter**, plus every GUI row.

# Recommendation-level evaluation

The table above tracks the 22 **findings**. This one tracks the 81 individual **recommendations** inside them. A finding moves to PARTIAL when some of these land and others do not, and the ones that do not are where the remaining work is.

Numbering follows each report's own Recommendations section, so `C6.3` is item 3 in the C6 report. Items that only list rejected alternatives or rollout timing are left out; rollout is the Gate column above. `T` marks a report's unnumbered test list.

**Verdicts.** `DONE` (implemented, commit named) · `PARTIAL` · `OPEN` (not done, still applies) · `SUPERSEDED` (the facts changed under it) · `DECLINED` (considered and not doing, reason given).

**A deliberate bias:** anything not verified against the tree is marked `OPEN`, not assumed done.

| Verdict | Count |
|-|-|
| DONE | 1 |
| PARTIAL | 0 |
| SUPERSEDED / DECLINED | 0 |
| **OPEN** | **80** |
| total | **81** |

## Consensus findings

| # | Recommendation | Verdict | Note |
|-|-|-|-|
| C1.1 | Truncate the replay at the first stored decision whose snapshot is not held; delete the exit | OPEN | Exit still at `bft.rs:1308-1320` |
| C1.2 | Correct the five stale comments about write ordering | OPEN | `zebra_db/bft.rs:53-55` and four in `bft.rs` |
| C1.3 | Optional: flush the snapshot to the backup at decision time | OPEN | `8cc3f5b7` gave the writer a `backup_task` handle, which removes the report's stated obstacle. It is used only at shutdown |
| C1.T | Tests: snapshot lost with the backup; backup disabled; two-node catch-up after truncation | OPEN | Route: `dilated` plus deleting the backup directory |
| C2.1 | Contextual difficulty check on every carried header in `validate`; `propose` uses the same helper | OPEN | `header_pow_is_valid` unchanged |
| C2.2 | Make the minimum-difficulty start height a `testnet::Parameters` field and turn it off for the new testnet | OPEN | Still hardcoded at 299,188. **Must land with C2.1** |
| C2.4 | Tests: forged tail rejected, side-chain variant, honest tail passes, minimum-difficulty case, helper unit test | OPEN | End-to-end needs a non-regtest harness |
| C3.1 | Entries expire unless a live proposal refreshes them, plus a hard cap | OPEN | Still a plain `HashSet`. The 30 s and 16 are suggestions, not measured |
| C3.2 | Run the header PoW check before the snapshot lookup in `validate` | OPEN | Does not bound the set on its own |
| C3.3 | Cap by-hash requests at a fixed share of the download budget | OPEN | |
| C3.5 | Tests: bogus snapshots do not stall sync; a real missing snapshot is still fetched; expiry and cap unit test | OPEN | |
| C4.1 | Remove the empty-store exit in `restore`; log and let the first tick re-derive genesis | OPEN | Guard at `bft.rs:1233-1245` |
| C4.2 | Rewrite the guard comment and `restore`'s doc comment | OPEN | |
| C4.3 | Keep the failed genesis write at `error`, and say the height is re-decided on next start | OPEN | |
| C4.T | Tests: empty store above activation; row 0 missing; one tick crosses activation | OPEN | Needs a row-deletion tool. Same tool as C10.4 |
| C5.1 | `bootstrap_is_valid` bounds `h1 + sigma` and rejects sigma of 0 | OPEN | The function was edited in `ca131a7d` for `h0` and still ignores sigma |
| C5.2 | `build_bootstrap_genesis` reads headers from the finalized database and logs a miss | OPEN | Also removes two of C10.3's casts |
| C5.4 | Tests: config-load rejection, boundary scenario, unit boundary cases | OPEN | The report's example heights now also need a valid `bootstrap_staking_height` |
| C6.1 | Persist the abandonment as a hazard row before the first commit past the fork | OPEN | `conflict_abandoned` is still memory only. Rides on the C6 decision |
| C6.2 | Add a detached state to `BftChain`: `validate` returns `Indeterminate`, `propose` declines | OPEN | Rides on the C6 decision |
| C6.3 | Replace `decide`'s `assert_eq!` with a match that parks an `Indeterminate` decision | OPEN | CLEAR regardless of the decision |
| C6.4 | Keep the tenderlink handle and abort it on detach; the push closure parks, never panics | OPEN | CLEAR regardless. Also covers the shutdown path noted under "Facts that moved" |
| C6.5 | `restore` starts detached when the hazard row explains the missing snapshot | OPEN | Same branch as C1.1 |
| C6.6 | Log the hold at `warn!`, repeat an `error!` while detached, add two gauges | OPEN | The hold log is still `debug!`, which release builds compile out |
| C6.T | Tests: test-format give-up scenario; decide-race integration test; dilated restart after give-up | OPEN | First is `intg`; the other two are `hard` |
| C7.1 | Record the voting roster per decided height; `certificate_is_valid` in `admit_fat_pointer` and on `previous_block_fat_ptr` | OPEN | Rides on the C7 decision. Worst case is now a 12-signature batch, since `3351fc4c` |
| C7.3 | Tests: malformed-certificate matrix; migrate the scenes that pass `sigs = &[]` | OPEN | The harness has no signing helper yet |
| C7.4 | File the Equihash grinding issue separately | **DONE** | It is report C11 |
| C8.1 | The request carries the template parent's hash; the height is derived from it | OPEN | |
| C8.2 | Both `getblocktemplate` sites send `chain_info.tip_hash`; return an RPC error instead of a null pointer | OPEN | Same null fallback as C9.1 and C10.3 |
| C8.4 | Tests: a template-on-named-parent instruction and a deep-reorg scenario | OPEN | |

## Sync finding

| # | Recommendation | Verdict | Note |
|-|-|-|-|
| S1.1 | Key the backoff by hash and connection: pass the serving peer when recording a strike and the candidate peer when checking | OPEN | The honest peers stay eligible while the peer that served the failed copy waits |
| S1.2 | Run the merkle check at receipt, before the block takes the queue slot for its hash | OPEN | Stops a merkle-mismatched body from shadowing the honest copy. The code already has an `@Todo` for it. The shadowing predates `e56e35f8` |
| S1.4 | Tests: six forged `RECV_POW` from one peer, then the honest block from another; a parent-missing variant; a unit test of the two pure functions | OPEN | At `e56e35f85` the sixth strike sets a 32 s wait, longer than the harness's 30 s answer wait. Inferred, not run |

# How the recommendations interact

The recommendations are not independent. Treating the 80 open ones as a flat backlog loses the pairs that must land together and the orderings that prevent a regression.

## Must land together (splitting them causes harm)

| Pair | Why | State |
|-|-|-|
| **C2.1 + C2.2** | The contextual check alone is bypassable. From height 299,188 the minimum-difficulty rule lets a proposer earn PoWLimit legitimately by spacing fake timestamps 150 s apart | Both OPEN |
| **C1.1 + C4.1 + C6.5 + C10.1** | All four change what `restore()` does when state is missing. Done separately, each fix rewrites the branch the previous one added | All OPEN |
| **C8.1 + C8.2 + C9.1** | The loop bound is only correct once the height and the parent agree, which C8 provides | All OPEN |
| **G2.3 + G6.2 + G6.3** | They share the notice line under the paste button. Clipboard failure takes priority over a validation error | All OPEN |
| **G4.1 + G9.3** | Both edit the modal hover code in `ui_left_pane` | Both OPEN |

## Ordering rules

| Rule | Source | State |
|-|-|-|
| **G3.1 before G2.1** | A working Windows clipboard makes the G3 node abort reachable on Windows | Not yet at risk: neither landed |
| **G10.1 before G10.2** | With focus on open and no Esc fix, Esc is dead from the first frame | Not yet at risk |
| **C11.2 before C11.1** | The digest definition depends on how carried headers prove their binding | Decision pending |
| **C11.1 and C7.1 before BFT activation** | Both change block validity after the first non-null pointer | Activation is height 36,288 on the shipped parameters |
| **C5.2 before or with C4.1** | Re-deriving genesis is only safe if genesis is a pure function of finalized data | Both OPEN |
| **C3.1 must keep a node's own stored decisions fetchable** | C1.1 relies on re-fetching the missing snapshot through this set | Design constraint on C3.1 |
| **Choose the template pointer before computing default roots** | After C11.1 the template's commitments depend on the pointer, and C8 edits the same `getblocktemplate` path | Coordinate C8 with C11 |
| **G3 before G6.2 and G6.3** | Same lines; the validation sits on top of the safe abbreviation | Both OPEN |

## Anti-correlated / mutually exclusive

| Tension | Resolution |
|-|-|
| **C6: re-anchor BFT on the node's own branch** vs **halt BFT on this node** | **Re-anchoring DECLINED in the report.** It allows two conflicting final snapshots. Halting the whole process is also declined: one cheap reorg would then shut every node down |
| **C6: interim detached state** vs **stage 9's second chain state** | **Open, this is the C6 decision.** The interim adds a database row that stage 9 would later replace |
| **C7: checked certificates** vs **hash-only pointer with empty signatures** | **Open, this is the C7 decision.** The design overview says the signatures are in the header so a link can be verified from it |
| **C11: exclude the pointer from the difficulty hash** | **DECLINED in the report.** It unbinds the pointer, so a relay could swap it for free |
| **C11: make the pointer canonical** | **DECLINED in the report.** Honest nodes hold different signature sets, and a roster key holder can re-sign |
| **C9: the original review's early stop as a speedup** | **SUPERSEDED.** The loop already stops there. The bound stays, as a correctness guard under C9.1 |
| **C3.2 alone** | Moving the PoW check earlier does not bound the set. It needs C3.1 |

## The same work, counted twice or more

| Work | Appears as |
|-|-|
| What `restore()` does when a snapshot or a row is missing | C1.1, C4.1, C6.5, C10.1 |
| Replace the null fat pointer fallbacks in `fat_pointer_for_template` with errors | C8.2, C9.1, C10.3 |
| Bound sigma in parameter validation | C5.1, C10.3 |
| Casts in `build_bootstrap_genesis` and `admit_fat_pointer` | C5.2, C7.1, C10.3 |
| `decide` must never abort the process on a lifecycle race | C6.3, C6.4, and the shutdown path under "Facts that moved" |
| A test tool that deletes database rows between stop and start | C4.T, C10.4 |
| A restart scenario in the dilated run | C1.T, C6.T |
| The notice line under the paste button | G2.3, G6.3 |
| Sanitising and abbreviating a pasted address | G3.1, G3.2, G6.2 |
| The Jump modal's hover and capture code | G4.1, G9.3 |

## Clusters: one decision or design unlocks many

| Cluster | Members | Blocked on |
|-|-|-|
| **Startup recovery** | C1.1 to C1.3, C4.1 to C4.3, C6.1, C6.2, C6.5, C10.1 | The C6 decision: interim detached state or stage 9 |
| **Carried-header binding** | C2.1, C2.2, C11.1, C11.2 | One decision, taken jointly, plus the minimum-difficulty policy |
| **Header certificate** | C7.1, C7.3 | One decision: checked or hash-only |
| **Template pointer** | C8.1, C8.2, C9.1, C9.2 | Nothing. Coordinate with C11.1 on the template roots |
| **Paste-an-address flows** | G2.1 to G2.4, G3.1, G3.2, G6.1 to G6.4 | Nothing. The order is in the GUI folder's README |
| **Pointer and keyboard routing** | G4.1, G4.2, G9.1 to G9.3, G10.1, G10.2 | Nothing |
| **Wrong figures** | G1.1, G7.1, G8.1, G8.2 | Nothing. Each is independent and unit-testable |

## Facts that moved under the reports

The consensus reports were written at `e99404e3de7cc`. Eight commits later, at `d00b6a44ef594`, these statements in them are out of date. The reports themselves have not been edited.

| Report | What it says | What is true now |
|-|-|-|
| C1 | A graceful stop is covered by the scenario, because nothing flushes the backup at shutdown | `8cc3f5b7` flushes the backup on a clean stop. Crash, hard kill and backup-off are unchanged |
| C1, C4, C6 | Restart tests need a new child-process harness | The dilated run already restarts both nodes past activation |
| C4, C5 | Roster height 75, activation height 275, gap 200 | Roster height 34,560, activation 36,288, gap 1,728, since `ca131a7d` and `00565513` |
| C5 | Margin of 196 blocks | Margin of 1,724 blocks. Still unexposed, and still unexposed if the reorg limit goes to 999 |
| C7, C11 | Up to 100 signatures in a pointer | Up to 12, since `3351fc4c` |
| C11 | After C7's fix, quorum-subset freedom reaches about 88.8 bits at 100 members | About 10.6 bits at 12 members. A roster key holder can still re-sign without limit, so the conclusion stands |
| all `write.rs` and `new_network.rs` citations | Line numbers | `write.rs` moved down about 10 lines. `new_network.rs` moved about 46 lines at `d00b6a44`, and again at `e56e35f8`, which adds about 100 lines above the commit loop. `bft.rs` line numbers are still exact |

### Re-check at `e56e35f8`

One commit landed after the first assessment: `e56e35f8`, "Answer every queued block through a fate table; back off re-fetching rejected blocks". It touches `new_network.rs`, the submit path in `methods.rs`, the two download components, six lines of `test_format.rs`, and adds one scenario test.

| Row | Effect |
|-|-|
| C1, C4, C6, C10 | None. `bft.rs` and `write.rs` are untouched |
| C3 | None. The new backoff applies to a block a peer served that failed verification. C3's bogus hashes are never served, so they never enter the backoff table, and `MISSING_POW_BLOCKS` is unchanged |
| C6 | None on the re-download loop. A by-hash block dropped as "already finalized" goes through the new `drop_block!` path, which reports to a test peer and does not start a backoff |
| C8 | None. The `methods.rs` change is in `submitblock`, where a held block now answers `Inconclusive`. There is still no tip check |
| C2, C5, C7, C9, C11, all `G` rows | None. Their files are untouched |
| F1, T1 | PARTIAL, as described in the test-format section |

Two things in the commit are new behaviour and belong to no row. When a served block fails verification, the peer is now disconnected only if the header is invalid, not for a bad body; the hash is retried after a backoff of 1 to 64 seconds. And `settle_fate` aborts the node if a queued block has no fate entry; both paths that queue a block insert one, checked by reading.

One new finding came out of this commit: the backoff is keyed by hash alone. It was raised by the "crosslink spreadsheet triage" session, validated by tracing the code, and is tracked as row S1 above. The lead as first stated overstated the reach, and the report records the corrections: the backoff gates only new requests, the node asks two peers per hash, and an honest download already in flight is not cancelled. It has not been raised with the commit's author.

One item is new and belongs to no report yet. `sync()` can now return at shutdown, which drops the BFT request receiver. A decision arriving at that moment may reach the `panic!` at `bft.rs:1517` or the `expect` at `:1520`, and the build aborts on panic. **This is inferred from reading and was not traced end to end.** C6.4 would cover it.

## Not tracked here

Both reviews cut lower-priority candidates to stay within their limit of ten. None was validated, so none has a row.

- **Consensus:** tenderlink's replies are answered only between ticks on the sync thread, so a burst of blocks may cause round timeouts; `validate()` compares hardforks byte by byte although the type derives `Eq`; `bft.rs:338-339` fills `ConsensusCounts` with signature counts where tenderlink uses stake-weighted sums.
- **GUI:** the nine items listed at the end of `crosslink-d00b6a44ef594-gui-review/README.md`.
- **Unconfirmed deployment facts:** the PoWLimit the new testnet will actually deploy with, and whether the `staking3d` network has already started. C2 and C11 are priced against the in-tree default of `2^251 - 1`.
